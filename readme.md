# Context : 

This is a school project, where we had to build an entire e-commerce website in a couple of month, while working in an agile way.
We were supposed to build a front-end, an api and a mobile app


## Technologies and requirement :

Everything you find here can also be found in our documentation, in more details.
It is advised to use Obsidian to read our documentation !

The entire stack relies on javascript, so you will need node in version 19.7 (as indicated in our .nvmrc s)

You will also need a postgres database.


## Quick recap on how to start the project.

1. Always start the backend first
2. Don't forget to get a .env from one of the developers, or to get the API keys you need yourself, as indicated in the documentation.

You shouldn't need more than 4go of ram to run the entire project, as long as you're not using a jetbrain IDE hogging all of your remaining memory.
