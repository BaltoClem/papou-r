Note: The email confirmation functionality is handled by helper functions `generateDynamicTemplateEmailForUserByTemplateID` and `sendEmailTemplate`. The `signJWTForUser` function is used to generate a JWT for the user during sign-up. The `auth` middleware is used to ensure that the user is authenticated when confirming their email. The `getCurrentUser` function is used to get the authenticated user from the request context.
